## Project Idea: Data Science Platform (Sample Description) [Don't Edit]

This project will build a platform for exploring large datasets and applying pre-built machine learning algorithms to the data. The team will implement a Java Spring-based web platform for uploading, browsing, and formatting datasets. In addition, the team will implement a variety of machine learning algorithms / techniques that can be applied to the data. The machine learning modules will primarily be implemented in Python.

The platform will focus on classification tasks. Users will be able to upload datasets in CSV or JSON and then select attributes of each data item to serve as labels. Once labeled datasets are available, users will be able to use graphical tools to draw a machine learning pipeline and choose algorithms to apply to the data without coding.

# All Project Ideas Down Here

## Web Scraping and Price Analysis 

An application that will show competitive prices for a certain product. These prices will be obtained through some form of web scraping and displaying the data on the site, as well as in the database. 

The idea behind this project is to create an application that functions as a hub or a "one stop shop" for a certain product. This will contain pertinent information to the user, such as the price of the product. This project is vague at the moment because there are numerous options for what the product can be (including shoes, clothes, textbooks, etc). Deciding on this product will come with more research on what websites allow scraping, to be extremely careful on what is done.

An example of the product is shoes. Say someone is looking for shoes from FootLocker, Finish Line & EastBay. Scraping the product pages from these websites will allow for the data, such as price, to be obtained and displayed on the website. With this website, users can look in one spot and compare prices from different competitors, lessoning the hassle of visiting many different websites to see prices and important information.


## Project Idea: Public Speaking Skills Enhancer

This project will build an application for users to practice their public speaking skills. The implementation of this application could change, but it is currently planned to be implemented using various Amazon Web Services tools including Amazon Transcribe, Lambda functions, DynamoDB, and Amazon Comprehend, etc. The user will speak to the device (phone, computer, etc.) for practice and this application will highlight possible fixes to enhance your public speaking. 

Some of the highlights will include identification of user customized keywords such as "umm", "uhh", and "like", analysis of both long and short pauses, and calculation of the tempo of the overall speech. The application will allow users to analyze both live and recorded speeches. The application will first display the transcribed speech with highlighted possible fixes and allow comparisons to other users/famous public speakers. Further development of this application could include identification of the tone and the volume of the speeches.


## Project Idea: Tinder Meets Netflix

 This project will build an application for users to help figure out what to watch on netflix or other streaming services with your friends. How this application works is you group up with the friends you want to watch with, in the group you select which streaming services you have available to check from, then you just swipe on movies until you all match on one together to watch. 
 
 This will help get rid of the struggle of trying to figure out what yo uall want to watch on different streaming services. This will also have some features such as allowing you to check genres you want and dont want to watch. You can have a friends list to make it easy to group with your friends when you want, and can see a history of past movies watched. 

## CityPark

I call my project City Park. Tell me how many times have you gone to any city (especially its downtown area) and found yourself circling countless city blocks before you can finally parallel park your big SUV into that spot that’s probably only meant for sedans? If I were a betting man, I’d guess your response would be “numerous” or “a lot”. Well, the idea for my project is an application to help combat all of this wasted time if you know your destination. Maybe think of it as Waze, but for parking. 

I see 3 main features of this application. I’d like it to be able to take an input location and based on how easily other users can park, output all available parking options if there are any. These parking options include parallel parking required, metered parking, garage, completely free parking, etc. Next, I’d like to store parking availabilities for certain areas and make predictions on availability in the case that no users are currently reporting data for that area. Finally, in the scenario that there is paid parking, I’d like to have a feature that interfaces between the customer who wants to park and the company/person who offers parking. This type of information would help the predictive feature but also would help customers so that they don’t have to be running back to their cars to put a ticket stub to say they paid for parking for the next 2 hours.

## Project Idea: ResQ

The fostering and adoption community of Nashville is in need of a platform to centralize communication between animal shelters, rescue organizations, and volunteers. As a proud member of the foster community, I receive 3-4 emails a week requesting an available foster for dogs in need – all ranging from sick dogs, to newly-born puppies, to pregnant moms. However, the communication between all parties is highly inefficient. Due to their frequency, the emails are often sent to spam, and if I reply to foster, I am left scrambling for information in a long email chain of information easily lost in my inbox. The volunteer often picks up directly from the animal shelter, where information from the rescue organization is not always transmitted clearly. On the other hand, the rescue organization deals with a large influx of responses, and it is not discernable whether or not the requested foster is equipped to deal with large dogs, small dogs, medical cases, etc. The current system can be greatly improved and I propose a platform to do so: ResQ.

ResQ is a platform where animal shelters, rescue organizations, volunteers, and potential adopters can communicate to achieve the mission of finding all dogs a forever home. Depending on your affiliation with one of the four above groups, the platform showcases different functionalities. Rescue organizations can post animals in need of fostering as well as any other relevant information: pictures, age, breed, pounds, personality, medical needs, behavior (i.e. potty trained), space requirement (i.e. large yard), pickup place and time, etc. If a request to foster is received, the organization can easily cross check stored information about the foster to make sure the individual is equipped to handle the animal’s needs. Foster volunteers are notified as soon as a new posting is up, and can scroll through the postings with highlighted relevant information, eliminating the inconvenience of many lengthy emails. Volunteers can also set their notifications to filter animals in certain categories; for example, Jane is only able to foster dogs under 40 pounds in her apartment and prefers puppies. Once a foster exchange is confirmed by the rescue organization, ResQ takes care of everything on the backend. ResQ communicates shelter information, directs the foster to the shelter, and schedules a time for supply pick up, removing the need for repetitive conversations with every foster. ResQ will also directly notify the animal shelter, and feature a messaging service in case additional information is needed between parties. Potential adopters will be able to scroll through a message board of dogs currently available for adoption, and apply through the platform – handling the paperwork for the rescue organization. As an added bonus, community members, adopters and fosters alike, will be able to donate to the shelters, rescue organizations, and urgent medical cases! ResQ streamlines the rescue, foster, and adoption process with a platform that gets dogs into homes – efficiently and lovingly. 

## YESplus
My software project idea is to add and/or extend some functionalities of Vanderbilt’s Your Enrollment Services (YES) site. This can be done through the use of a Google Chrome extension which students can choose to install or, for better accessibility, an integrated widget which launches specified “extra” functionalities. I see this project as a way to learn more about web integration and containers while also potentially helping out future Vanderbilt students during course registration.

A widget display popup in the Student Registration section could allow students to see useful resources, such as their degree audits or weekly schedule based on enrolled and/or in-cart courses, while browsing for courses. Another useful resource that once existed as a Chrome extension for YES, the Rate My Professor extension which displayed professors’ ratings according to RMP next to their names under courses, could be remade and reintegrated. These functions could be created and extended to YES through use of Java/JS.


## Project Idea: Spotify Friend Recommendations

One of the best features of Spotify is how social it is with the ability to follow your friends, see what they're listening to, and easily share playlists. Additionally, Spotify has robust algorithms used to create recommended playlists based on individual preferences. For my senior design project I plan to combine these features to make it easier to share music recommendations with friends. I will create a web application to generate customized playlists for Spotify users based on the music their friends are listening to.

Spotify has a large collection of personalized playlists already-- Discover Weekly, Release Radar, Daily Mix, etc. The application will use a similar algorithm to create a playlist consisting of songs chosen from another user’s public playlists. This project will involve using the Spotify Web API to access a user’s profile and preferences, as well as creating the user interface for the web app.


## recruit.com: All-in-One Solution for Undergraduate Recruitment

As we are now entering the second semester of our senior year, we all have seen countless friends engage in months-long frenzies to recruit for internships and jobs. I found that this recruitment process, one that begins in freshman year for some, was extremely overwhelming and complicated. The information necessary to navigate the complexities of this process was scattered, varied, and certainly not consolidated onto a single platform. While resources like company websites, online forums, the Vanderbilt career center, and employer information sessions were helpful in navigating the internship/job market, I never came across an all-in-one resource that could help guide a college student through this process of transitioning into the working world. My project proposal is to attempt to create an all-encompassing online resource in the form of a website that streamlines the recruitment process for undergraduate students and helps them both discover the employment possibilities that exist as well as how they can obtain such possibilities. This could be thought of as a DoreWays on steroids. (It could also be integrated with DoreWays and websites like Vault.com.)

While the scope of this project will certainly need to be narrowed, I would like to mention just a few of the potential features this website could have:

Multi-Industry Exploration: A section of the website dedicated to informing students of some of the most popular industries for Vanderbilt graduates. This section could include statistics related to the number of recent Vanderbilt graduates who entered various industries, their salaries, and the positions they hold. It could also include contact information and interviews with former students about their current roles and industries. (The school of engineering publishes similar data yearly.)

Single-Industry Exploration: A section of the website dedicated to a specific industry such as the technology industry. Such a section could include popular entry-level positions (SWE, PM, Data Scientist), their associated salaries, difficulty of attainment, recruitment process, Vanderbilt alumni, etc. (Such a section could be linked to external ranking and informational sites such as Vault.com.)

Role-Specific Recruitment Pipeline: Such a section would give a comprehensive overview of a single recruitment pipeline, such as that of SWE. It could provide the user with features such as the overall process and timeline for general internship/job recruitment, the skills necessary for position-specific interviews, as well as links to preparation resources.

User Candidate Hub: Such a section would allow users to conglomerate industries, companies, and roles they are interested in as well as track their “progress” in their overall recruitment strategy. This “progress” could be companies they are in contact with, scheduled an interview with, received an offer from, etc.

## Used Textbook Marketplace
This project will address the difficulties that students face in buying and selling college textbooks. Used textbooks are sold at meager 20%-30% discounts from publishing houses and bought back at 60-70% discounts, revelaing a large profit margin that could be returned to students by removing the monopolistic grip that publishers hold over this market.
This project would establish a marketplace for buyers and sellers to transact, in hopes of helping both parties, and lessening the assymetric information gap that publishers leverage and exploit. 

The platform would require students to validate their identity with their email address and phone number. When submitting a bid or an ask, the students would have to specify the course, the book name, author, and volume/edition, the desired/existing condition, a few pictures of the book in the case of an ask, and the price of the bid/ask. Upon placement of a bid/ask, the publishers of an existing listings would be notified via email/text of the bid/ask details, regardless of if the request falls within their acceptable margins, to facilitate negotiation and exchange. The application wouldn't be responsible for the negotiation process or the financial transaction, as those responsibilities would fall on text/message/social media apps and cash/check/online payment apps, respectively. 


## HeartbreAKA Website Phase 2
Every year, the Elegant Eta Beta Chapter of Alpha Kappa Alpha Sorority, Inc. has hosted a date auction event where attendees can donate money and art supplies to receive AKA dollars which can be used to bid on the bachelors during the event. Due to COVID, the chapter can not hold their event in person this year. Therefore, they wanted a website to be built that could be used to facilitate gathering donations and hosting the live auction.

Last semester, the website was built to their standards. However, the current state of the website requires that someone with coding experience would need to know how to change anything on the website. That is the goal for this semester! As a team, we would work  to create a localized database structure that could serve as a place to store all the data that is currently hardcoded in the website (i.e. text and pictures). We would also work to create a UI that can allow for a future member of the chapter to change the contents of the website. In addition to that, we will work on implementing a way for the colors and layout of the website to be changed based on their preference. This project will be a great opportunity to learn new skills in website design and database management.

## Crafting-centric roguelike
Roguelikes are a genre of role-playing games with a long history, and they are known for characteristics like high degree of randomness in the generation of levels, permanent character loss with little inheritance between playthroughs, emergent gameplay due to systems interacting with each other, and a focus on management of limited resources in the form of randomly generated items (both permanent equipments and single-use items). In addition, they are often turn-based, set in an enclosed "dungeon" setting (courtesy of DND campaigns, one of their main inspirations) and features tile-based ASCII graphics. My idea is to create such a game but with a highly integrated crafting and equipment-customization system, with enhanced ASCII based graphics, modernized UI, and cross-platform support.

In this idea, instead of generating items with unidentified but unchanging purpose, raw materials would be generated in the map instead. The player would need to find or construct crafting stations to make raw materials into equipments and single-use items useful for survival and progression. The said equipments would be highly modular, and spending more materials to enhance, modify and add new attributes to existing equipments would be the main form of progression in this game. Crafting and modifying of equipments require recipes which can be character innate, found through progression in the form of randomly generated blueprints, or discovered via consuming raw materials and enemy drops. 

## Survival iOS app
This project will create an iOS app that is level based. The objective of the app is to avoid obstacles by tilting a player around a map with a limited number of lives. This app will utilize the tilt features of iOS development and will require basic object interactions. While the first game mode will consist of a basic survival playstyle where losing all lives requires starting over at level 1, different game modes can then be built out from this.

Development of this app will not require sophisticated background design and should focus on smooth playthrough with difficult but rewarding levels which are creative and unique. By the end of this development, a strong understanding of tilt mechanics within iOS, the in-game physics, and basic object design will be required to create the final product. Development of this project would be most effective with 3 or less members.

## Project Idea: ML Model Generator Interface

This project will build an interface with the Vanderbilt TV News Archive that will allow for the creation and training of AI (primarily machine learning) models. Primary component will consist of a python based program utilizing at least PyTorch and Scikit Learn if not additionally Tensorflow, and possibly other deep learning frameworks. This program recieve the following parameters: Task category (classificaiton, regression, etc.), task target (classifying segment type, generating captions for audio, etc.) model structure and training parameters.

Once model creation has been tested and is functional, additional time will be spent adding additional options for model creation, as well as developing a django based API for requesting and sending models.
