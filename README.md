## Project Idea: Data Science Platform (Sample Description) [Don't Edit]

This project will build a platform for exploring large datasets and applying pre-built machine learning algorithms to the data. The team will implement a Java Spring-based web platform for uploading, browsing, and formatting datasets. In addition, the team will implement a variety of machine learning algorithms / techniques that can be applied to the data. The machine learning modules will primarily be implemented in Python. 

The platform will focus on classification tasks. Users will be able to upload datasets in CSV or JSON and then select attributes of each data item to serve as labels. Once labeled datasets are available, users will be able to use graphical tools to draw a machine learning pipeline and choose algorithms to apply to the data without coding.

##Speech-to-Zork

In the advent of the gig economy, many delivery-people rely on audio entertainment to pass the time while driving long hours. I hope to offer a new alternative
utilizing the text-based designs of gaming’s past. This project will create a mobile console to play text-based games via voice commands. The app would offer a
suite of open-source text games (Zork, Oregon Trail, etc.) that can be played via speech recognition. 

React Native will be used for cross-device compatibility to create a SaaP ‘app’. Ideally, an adapter will be created to connect our speech interface to the CLI
games. An online catalogue of downloadable games would probably be necessary to reduce local overhead.
