## Project Idea: Data Science Platform (Sample Description) [Don't Edit]

This project will build a platform for exploring large datasets and applying pre-built machine learning algorithms to the data. The team will implement a Java Spring-based web platform for uploading, browsing, and formatting datasets. In addition, the team will implement a variety of machine learning algorithms / techniques that can be applied to the data. The machine learning modules will primarily be implemented in Python. 

The platform will focus on classification tasks. Users will be able to upload datasets in CSV or JSON and then select attributes of each data item to serve as labels. Once labeled datasets are available, users will be able to use graphical tools to draw a machine learning pipeline and choose algorithms to apply to the data without coding.

## recruit.com: All-in-One Solution for Undergraduate Recruitment

As we are now entering the second semester of our senior year, we all have seen countless friends engage in months-long frenzies to recruit for internships and jobs. I found that this recruitment process, one that begins in freshman year for some, was extremely overwhelming and complicated. The information necessary to navigate the complexities of this process was scattered, varied, and certainly not consolidated onto a single platform. While resources like company websites, online forums, the Vanderbilt career center, and employer information sessions were helpful in navigating the internship/job market, I never came across an all-in-one resource that could help guide a college student through this process of transitioning into the working world. My project proposal is to attempt to create an all-encompassing online resource in the form of a website that streamlines the recruitment process for undergraduate students and helps them both discover the employment possibilities that exist as well as how they can obtain such possibilities. This could be thought of as a DoreWays on steroids. (It could also be integrated with DoreWays and websites like Vault.com.)

While the scope of this project will certainly need to be narrowed, I would like to mention just a few of the potential features this website could have:

Multi-Industry Exploration: A section of the website dedicated to informing students of some of the most popular industries for Vanderbilt graduates. This section could include statistics related to the number of recent Vanderbilt graduates who entered various industries, their salaries, and the positions they hold. It could also include contact information and interviews with former students about their current roles and industries. (The school of engineering publishes similar data yearly.)

Single-Industry Exploration: A section of the website dedicated to a specific industry such as the technology industry. Such a section could include popular entry-level positions (SWE, PM, Data Scientist), their associated salaries, difficulty of attainment, recruitment process, Vanderbilt alumni, etc. (Such a section could be linked to external ranking and informational sites such as Vault.com.)

Role-Specific Recruitment Pipeline: Such a section would give a comprehensive overview of a single recruitment pipeline, such as that of SWE. It could provide the user with features such as the overall process and timeline for general internship/job recruitment, the skills necessary for position-specific interviews, as well as links to preparation resources.

User Candidate Hub: Such a section would allow users to conglomerate industries, companies, and roles they are interested in as well as track their “progress” in their overall recruitment strategy. This “progress” could be companies they are in contact with, scheduled an interview with, received an offer from, etc.
