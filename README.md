## Project Idea: Data Science Platform (Sample Description) [Don't Edit]

This project will build a platform for exploring large datasets and applying pre-built machine learning algorithms to the data. The team will implement a Java Spring-based web platform for uploading, browsing, and formatting datasets. In addition, the team will implement a variety of machine learning algorithms / techniques that can be applied to the data. The machine learning modules will primarily be implemented in Python. 

The platform will focus on classification tasks. Users will be able to upload datasets in CSV or JSON and then select attributes of each data item to serve as labels. Once labeled datasets are available, users will be able to use graphical tools to draw a machine learning pipeline and choose algorithms to apply to the data without coding.

## Project Idea: Voice Controlled Website Navigation

The project goal is to build a platform that enables users to customize a voice controlled chrome navigation extension. Users will be able to link their specified voice commands for general navigation from opening up a website to creating their own command that works specifically on certain websites. This can be implemented using a variety of speech recognition APIs such as Google Speech API, Speech API, Web Speech API, etc. 

The project allows for a host of additional features such as the ability to recognize multiple languages, linking commands together with a single command, enable private mode and so on. Users will be able to create commands using drag and drop features linking a command to a single action or a chain of actions. From there, commands can be linked together possibly allowing sentence activated commands.
